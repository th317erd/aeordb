# Child 01 Progress: Format

- **Status:** P0b in progress; P0b-1 complete
- **Current landing unit:** P0b-2 remaining Round 10-15 persistent families and mutation coverage
- **Entry commit:** `9eb503b1d8dbee62e2d90493ecf7010075bc2792`
- **Last green commit:** P0a stabilized baseline `9eb503b1d8dbee62e2d90493ecf7010075bc2792`
- **Owner:** Codex, persistent-format/reference owner
- **Start gate:** Child 08 P0a inventory/baseline accepted
- **Plan:** [Child 01](../children/01-format-capabilities-and-fixtures.md)
- **Owned files:** this ledger; `tools/v4-reference/`; `aeordb-lib/spec/fixtures/v4/`; P0b/P0c clauses in `scripts/plan/check-v4-contracts.sh`
- **Forbidden/hotspot files:** production Rust codecs/readers/writers, root Cargo workspace membership, GC/query/index/namespace behavior, real/evidence databases, `.codex/DETAILS.md`, `.codex/wip.md`, and `downloads/`
- **Hotspot handoff commit:** none
- **Narrow gate:** `timeout 2m ./scripts/plan/check-v4-contracts.sh`
- **Broad gate:** P0a stabilized workspace gate passed at entry; P0b-1 is reference/fixture-only and passed its standalone tool tests and static analysis
- **Drift/risks:** repository-wide Clippy is red at entry and tracked by Child 08; independent fixture review remains distinct from later production codec authorship
- **Evidence:** Child 08 P0a evidence commit `5009cd2d975577a207556c605c4e90fdd1ef18cb`, GC stabilization `9b96586959bd4f3011e088f22bb5f1df01cfacae`, and ledger commit `9eb503b1d8dbee62e2d90493ecf7010075bc2792`. P0b-1 first failed because the independent reference manifest was absent, then passed with 10 annotated `DatabaseHeaderV4` fixtures covering 32- and 64-byte hashes, A/B selection, degraded redundancy, equal-sequence ambiguity, CRC rejection, unknown capability, reserved/padding rejection, and physical-ID adoption. `cargo test` passed 4 tests; standalone strict Clippy passed; fresh generation and verification passed; and `timeout 2m ./scripts/plan/check-v4-contracts.sh` passed with 93 routes and 36 docs.
- **Next action:** expand the registry and independent oracle across the remaining persistent families, formulas, malformed classes, canonical values, APOS, and SystemFamily fixture/digest required by P0b-2
